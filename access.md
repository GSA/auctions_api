title: Requesting Access to SAM Data

### Requesting Access

#### SAM API

The RESTful SAM API is open to the public! Once in production, the access to the API will be only available through [api.data.gov](http://api.data.gov). You will need an API key. The rate limits are set to the current defaults of 10,000 calls a day and 5 calls a second.

#### SAM Entity Extracts and Interfaces

The SAM Entity Extracts and Interfaces are currently all restricted to use only by other government agencies. The best way to keep on the events around the extract and interfaces is to speak to your IAE Change Control Board member and get onto the SAM Interfaces and Extracts Working Group (SIEWG).
