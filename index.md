### Overview

[GSA Auctions](http://www.gsaauctions.gov) offers Federal personal property assets ranging from common place items (such as office equipment and furniture) to more select products like scientific equipment, heavy machinery, airplanes, vessels and vehicles. GSA Auctions' online capabilities allow GSA to offer assets located across the country to any interested buyer, regardless of location. 

GSA Auctions API is a public GET API. The Auction listings will be delivered to the user in two formats. One is JSON and the other one is XML.  The auction listings delivered thru the API contains the auction listings from all the participating agencies.   

##### Get started
We organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics) introduces you to the operations offered by the API. 
- [Field reference](fields) lists and describes the type of information provided by the API.
- [API Key](key) will be provided by api.data.gov for more personal access of API data. 
- [Feedback](https://github.com/GSA/Auctions_api/issues) provides a forum for developers to share feedback and report problems.
