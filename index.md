### Overview

The Auctions API is a get API for retrieving GSA Auction listings.  

##### Get started
We organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an interactive console.
- [Field reference](fields.html) lists and describes the type of information provided by the API.
- [Feedback](https://github.com/GSA/GSA-APIs/issues) provides a forum for developers to share feedback and report problems.
