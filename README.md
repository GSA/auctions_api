## Using JavaScript and Bower

If you are going to work on the JavaScript for this site, you need to do the following:

* Run `npm install -g bower` to install Bower.
* Run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install Grunt.
* Run `npm install` in the directory to install other tools.
* Run `bower install` to install dependencies.
* Run `bundle install` to install additional dependencies. 

After changing the JavaScript, run `grunt` to rebuild the minified JS.
